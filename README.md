# rent-a-car-with-javascript
Using Javascript, I designed a car rental panel where customers can add or remove cars dynamically and rent these cars.

When the page is opened, our dynamic web page, where you can add users and cars and rent these vehicles to users, opens as an empty.

Added new users are added to the list of users in the rental menu.

If the car is rented before to someone else, we return an error message to our user.

Finally, our system does not allow renting a car under certain conditions. Instead, it returns an error message to the user.

I will add new features to this project, which I created in order to reinforce what I learned during my Javascript learning process.
